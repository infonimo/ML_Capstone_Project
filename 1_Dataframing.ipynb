    "I am a passionate about basketball and I have been playing this sport since 1996, therefore it was obvious that I wanted to work on this topic. By definition a good Data Scientist (which I don't pretend to be today) has to not only have some good knownledge in Math/Statistics and in Computer Science, but also to be a subject matter expert. \n",

    "In this following exercice, I would like to build __a supervised machine learning__ model based on historical data to predict the number of points made by a single player, for any specific game. I am using data from the NBA (National Basketball Association) which is by far the most famous and renowned league around the world. Based on the data available, I don't expect to have an incredibly high accuracy, because not all parameters can be retrieved on a dataset (such as the player mood and other external factors), but more to be able to extract some trends. __My target will be to predict the number of points made per game for a chosen player__.\n",
    "\n",
    "My work is split in 3 notebooks:\n",
    " - This one treats how to prepare the data; from merging multiple dataframe together, cleaning some irrelevant data and creating new features to try to enhance the robustness of my models.\n",
    " - The second one about Exploratory Data Analysis will go into details of the Dataframes we built over the first notebooks. Although some information will display comparison amongst all players, a focus will be done on Lebron James.\n",
    " - The last notebooks will work on my regression problem with the application of some models to have the most accurate prediction of point scored for one player. On top of this, I duplicated this part to apply to one other player to compare results.\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that for the sake of this exercice and due to the size of my dataset, I want to focus only on 1 player. However, I built my notebooks in a way that it is easily exportable for other players.\n",
